Testing area for individual serial communication between two photons



Update Jun10, 2017

Need to tweak most files, I2C working, UART not sperated yet. SPI not yet working.

For all images assume the Master is on top and the slave below, but from a connection point of view it does not matter (I think :>).

Note: For uART only Rx connects to TX and Tx connects to RX
