Making a Particle-Photon-Testing breadboard and perhaps a PCB to go along with it.

Update June 4, 2017

Now working on AnalogWrite PWM to an analogRead using an LED and photoresitor. Will need to think through the fuzzy logic to be able to test if it is working since light levels may be different using diffrerent LED's


Got DACs working set DAC variable voltage to analogReads to test 3 levels 1000, 2000, 3000 with a little fuzzy logic to see if they were correct.



Started Jun 2, 2017

Got digital input and outputs all working byu connecting every pin together and setting all of them to inputs until one at a time set to output.
